/**
 * This is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm.
 * 
 * A sub-list is maintained which is always sorted. 
 * For example, the lower part of an array is maintained to be sorted. 
 * An element which is to be 'insert'ed in this sorted sub-list, 
 * has to find its appropriate place and then it has to be inserted there. 
 * Hence the name, insertion sort.
 * 
 * The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are moved 
 * and inserted into the sorted sub-list (in the same array). 
 * This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average 
 * and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2), where n is the number of items.
